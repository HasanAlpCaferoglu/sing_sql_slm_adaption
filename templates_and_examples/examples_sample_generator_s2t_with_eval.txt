Column meaning: The \"part supply comment\" column in the \"partsupp\" table of the \"retails\" database stores textual descriptions related to the supply of parts, with examples including comments on supply conditions or characteristics.
Table name: `partsupp`
Column name: `ps_availqty`
Column meaning: In the 'retails' database, within the 'partsupp' table, the 'part supply available quantity' column (integer type) indicates the current stock level of parts. Values under 10 suggest a stock nearing depletion.
Table name: `partsupp`
Column name: `ps_supplycost`
Column meaning: The 'part supply cost' column in the 'partsupp' table of the 'retails' database, of type real, represents the cost of supplying a part. It is used to calculate profit in the formula: profit = (l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity), where 'l_quantity' is sourced from the 'lineitem' table.

Query Logic and Operations:\n   - The query joins the `logins` and `payments` tables on the user ID to link activities from the same user.\n   - A `WHERE` clause filters these joined records.
