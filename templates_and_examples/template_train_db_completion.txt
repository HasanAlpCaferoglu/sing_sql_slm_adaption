*** You are an expert database administrator. You are given a partial schema definition for the {DB_ID} database.
Your task is to identify the missing tables and/or columns required to complete the schema based on your knowledge of the full database structure. Provide the missing parts in JSON format.

### INTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the Given Schema::
    - Carefully examine the provided partial schema definition for the {DB_ID} database. Note which tables and columns are present.
2. Recall Full Schema:
    - Access your internal knowledge of the complete, correct schema for the {DB_ID} database, including all tables and their respective columns. 
3. Identify Discrepancies:
    - Compare the provided partial schema against the full schema you know. Systematically determine Which tables exist in the full schema but are entirely absent from the partial schema.
    - For tables present in both the given (partial) and full schema, identify which columns exist in the full schema but are missing from the given schema definition for that table.
4. Output the selected database items:
    - Write the missing database tables and columns
