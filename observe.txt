\n== frpm ==\n The user wants to count the number of schools that meet two criteria: having an average SAT Math score greater than 400 and being 'exclusively virtual'. The hint specifies that 'exclusively virtual' corresponds to `Virtual = 'F'`. The information about 'Virtual' status and 'average score in Math' is not in the `frpm` table but in the `schools` and `satscores` tables, respectively, as indicated by the provided examples. To connect the `frpm` table with these other tables, a join is necessary. The `CDSCode` column serves as the primary key in this table and is used as a foreign key to link to the `schools` and `satscores` tables. Therefore, `CDSCode` is essential for performing the required joins to filter and count the schools based on the conditions on columns from other tables. No other column in the `frpm` table is relevant to the user's question about virtual status or SAT scores. \n\n== satscores ==\n The user wants to count the number of schools that meet two criteria: an average math score greater than 400 and being 'exclusively virtual'.\n\n- `cds`: This column is the primary key for the `satscores` table and is used to uniquely identify each school. It is necessary to join this table with the `schools` table, which contains the 'Virtual' status information mentioned in the hint. It will also be used to count the number of schools.\n- `rtype`: This column indicates the record type. The user's question does not involve filtering or grouping by record type. Therefore, this column is not relevant.\n- `sname`: This column contains the name of the school. The question asks for a count ('How many schools'), not the names of the schools. Thus, this column is not needed.\n- `dname`: This column contains the district name. The question does not refer to districts. Therefore, this column is not relevant.\n- `cname`: This column contains the county name. The question does not refer to counties. Therefore, this column is not relevant.\n- `enroll12`: This column represents the 12th-grade enrollment. The question is not about enrollment numbers. Therefore, this column is not needed.\n- `NumTstTakr`: This column represents the number of test takers. The question does not involve the number of test takers. Therefore, this column is not needed.\n- `AvgScrRead`: This column is the average reading score. The question is specifically about the average math score. Therefore, this column is not relevant.\n- `AvgScrMath`: This column is the average math score. The question explicitly requires filtering for schools with an 'average score in Math greater than 400'. This column is essential for the condition in the query.\n- `AvgScrWrite`: This column is the average writing score. The question is specifically about the average math score. Therefore, this column is not relevant.\n- `NumGE1500`: This column represents the number of students with a total SAT score of 1500 or greater. The question is about the average math score, not the total score. Therefore, this column is not needed. \n\n== schools ==\n The user wants to count the number of schools that meet two criteria: having an average SAT Math score greater than 400 and being 'exclusively virtual'.\n- `CDSCode`: This column is the primary key for the `schools` table and is used to join with other tables, such as `satscores` which contains the SAT score information. It is necessary to link the school's virtual status with its SAT scores and to perform the count of schools.\n- `Virtual`: This column is essential because the question explicitly filters for schools that are 'exclusively virtual'. The hint clarifies that this corresponds to `Virtual = 'F'`. Therefore, this column is required for the WHERE clause of the query.\n- The question asks for a count of schools based on a condition on 'average score in Math'. This score is not in the `schools` table but in the `satscores` table, as seen in the examples. Thus, a join is required, making `CDSCode` necessary. No other columns from the `schools` table are needed to answer this specific question. \n
